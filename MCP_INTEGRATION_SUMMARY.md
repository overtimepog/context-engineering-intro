## MCP Tools Integrated

### 1. Context7
- **Purpose**: Library documentation
- **Usage**: Resolve library IDs, get current docs
- **Integration**: Both PRP generation and execution

### 2. Perplexity
- **Purpose**: AI-powered research
- **Usage**: Concept understanding, best practices
- **Integration**: Research phase, problem solving

### 3. Brave Search
- **Purpose**: Web search
- **Usage**: Find examples, current information
- **Integration**: Research phase, debugging

### 4. Sequential Thinking
- **Purpose**: Complex reasoning
- **Usage**: Problem decomposition, planning
- **Integration**: Planning and debugging phases

### 5. Playwright MCP
- **Purpose**: Web testing
- **Usage**: E2E testing, UI validation
- **Integration**: Testing and validation phases

## Key Governance Principles Added

1. **Core Principles**
   - KISS, YAGNI, SOLID
   - Plan > Prompt
   - Fail Fast
   - Real Data Only

2. **Quality Standards**
   - ≥85% test coverage
   - 100% type coverage
   - Zero linting errors
   - Comprehensive documentation

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
   - Git checkpoints after validation
   - Continuous documentation updates

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Input validation
   - Audit logging
   - Change management

## Research Workflow

### Standard Process
1. **Identify Needs** → What information required?
2. **Select Tools** → Which MCP tools to use?
3. **Parallel Research** → Execute simultaneously
4. **Document Findings** → Save to /research/
5. **Cite Sources** → Include URLs and dates
6. **Apply Knowledge** → Use in implementation

### Research Requirements
- Minimum 30 sources for new features
- All findings saved to /research/[feature]/
- Citations required for all information
- Cross-reference multiple sources

## Testing Integration

### Validation Gates
1. **Syntax & Style**: ruff, mypy
2. **Unit Tests**: pytest with coverage
3. **Integration Tests**: API and service tests
4. **E2E Tests**: Playwright MCP for web UI

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests first
- Validate after each section
- Git checkpoint on success
- Use Playwright for web features

## Usage Examples

### Generating PRP with Research
```
/generate-prp INITIAL.md
```
- Uses all MCP tools for research
- Saves findings to /research/
- Creates comprehensive blueprint

### Executing with Validation
```
/execute-prp PRPs/feature.md
```
- Uses sequential thinking for planning
- Implements with continuous validation
- Creates git checkpoints
- Runs comprehensive tests

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Real-time, verified information
2. **Efficiency**: Parallel research capabilities
3. **Quality**: Enforced standards and validation
4. **Traceability**: All research documented
5. **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing

## Next Steps
