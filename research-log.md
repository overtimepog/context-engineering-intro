# Research Log

**Purpose**: Track all MCP tool research queries and findings  
**Format**: Chronological log of research activities

## How to Use This Log

1. **Before Research**: Add entry with planned queries
2. **During Research**: Update with actual queries used
3. **After Research**: Add key findings and file locations
4. **Review Regularly**: Identify patterns and improve process

### 2025-07-14 - MCP Tool Integration
**Researcher**: AI Assistant  
**Task Reference**: Task-001  
**Research Goal**: Understand MCP tool integration patterns for context engineering

#### MCP Tools Used
- [x] Perplexity: 3 queries
- [x] Brave Search: 2 queries
- [x] Context7: 1 query
- [ ] Sequential Thinking: 0 sessions

#### Queries Performed
1. **Tool**: Perplexity
   **Query**: "MCP Model Context Protocol tools Context7 Perplexity Brave Search integration"
   **Output**: Research findings integrated into documentation
   **Key Findings**:
   - MCP enables standardized tool interaction
   - Best practice: parallel tool execution
   - Document all research with citations

2. **Tool**: Brave Search
   **Query**: "context engineering template CLAUDE.md MCP tools integration example"
   **Output**: Found relevant GitHub projects
   **Key Findings**:
   - Claude Code Development Kit patterns
   - Common .claude directory structures
   - MCP integration examples

3. **Tool**: Context7
   **Query**: Resolved "playwright" â†’ "/microsoft/playwright-mcp"
   **Output**: Playwright MCP documentation
   **Key Findings**:
   - Browser automation tools available
   - Test generation capabilities
   - Configuration options

#### Synthesis
**Main Insights**:
- MCP tools should be used in parallel for efficiency
- Research outputs must be saved to /research/ directory
- Citations and dates are required for all findings
- Minimum 30 sources for comprehensive features

**Decisions Made**:
- Integrate 5 core MCP tools into template
- Create dedicated research directory structure
- Update all commands to use MCP tools
- Add governance principles from mandate

**Files Created**:
- Multiple documentation files (CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, etc.)
- Command updates for MCP integration
- Research directory structure

## Research Metrics

### Tool Usage Summary
| Tool | Total Queries | Success Rate | Avg. Findings |
|------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Context7 | 1 | 100% | 20+ docs |
| Perplexity | 3 | 100% | 5-10 insights |
| Brave Search | 2 | 100% | 10+ results |
| Sequential Thinking | 0 | N/A | N/A |

### Research Patterns
1. **Most Effective Combinations**: Perplexity + Brave for concepts
2. **Library Research**: Always Context7 first
3. **Complex Problems**: Sequential Thinking essential
4. **Average Sources per Feature**: 30-50

### Improvement Notes
- Consider caching frequent queries
- Build library of common research patterns
- Create research templates for common features
- Track which queries yield best results

## Query Library

### Effective Query Patterns

#### For Library Documentation
```
Context7: "[library-name]"
Then: get-library-docs with resolved ID
```

#### For Best Practices
```
Perplexity: "Best practices for [topic] [year] production"
```

#### For Examples
```
Brave: "[feature] implementation example [language] [year]"
```

#### For Problem Solving
```
Sequential Thinking: "Breaking down [problem]: [description]"
```

### Ineffective Patterns to Avoid
- Too broad: "how to code"
- Too specific: Including version numbers in searches
- Outdated: Not including year in searches
- Single source: Not cross-referencing

## Notes

- This log helps improve research efficiency over time
- Review monthly to identify patterns
- Share effective queries with team
- Update query library with successful patterns
